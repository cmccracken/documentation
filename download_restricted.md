# Accessing Controlled Access Data

In addition to the public data available via the NeMO HTTP Browser and the NeMO Data Portal, the archives also host a number of restricted, or controlled access, datasets. Here you will find available datasets, instructions for requesting access, and preliminary download account instructions.

### Restricted Datasets
The following datasets will be the initial sets made available for controlled access. Additional datasets will be added as we receive Institutional Certification documents. If you think your dataset is missing, please contact hhuot@som.umaryland.edu. 

| Dataset | PI | Description | Funding Source |
|---------|----|-------------|----------------|
|Shen_3D_epigenome | Yin Shen | Cell type-specific 3D epigenomes in the developing human cortex: Here, we analyze cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational human cortex samples. |     |      |
|kriegstein_sc_10x| Arnold Kriegstein | A Cellular Resolution Census of the Developing Human Brain.  | BICCN |
|lein_lein_pseq_tx | Ed Lein | A multimodal atlas of human brain cell types: Transcriptomic profiles of individual human cortical neurons were assayed by the SMART-seq v4 single nucleus RNA-seq method following acute brain slice patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings and nucleus extraction—i.e. the Patch-seq method.  Surgically-resected brain tissue specimens were collected with patient consent and in the course of neurosurgical procedures for tumor removal or for treatment of epilepsy.  De-identified patient metadata were also collected and accompany the dataset comprised of 318 human cortical neurons from the temporal>frontal>parietal lobes of 56 unique donors. | BICCN | Other, Brain in health & disease |



### Obtaining NDA Approval

Permissions for restricted data access at NeMO are being facilitated by the [NIMH Data Archive (NDA)](https://nda.nih.gov/). NDA and NeMO are working together to ensure a smooth process. We regret to inform you that prior dbGaP access authorization does not transfer to NDA, therefore a separate NDA access request will need to be submitted.

NDA provides a [tutorial on accessing shared NIMH data here](https://nda.nih.gov/training/module?trainingModuleId=training.access&slideId=slide.access.intro). Note that only the first few steps of this tutorial are applicable in this case, as data is being stored at NeMO, rather than at NIMH. 

The steps required for restricted data access are as follows:

1)	[Create an NDA account](https://nda.nih.gov/user/create_account.html)  
**NDA ACCOUNT REQUESTS MUST BE MADE USING AN INSTITUTIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS**. Account requests made from a personal account will not be honored by NeMO and will therefore greatly slow down the process of accessing data.

2) Log in to the [NDA Permissions Dashboard](https://nda.nih.gov/user/dashboard/data_permissions.html).  

3) Identify the relevant BRAIN/NeMO Data Archives dataset(s). To the right is an 'Actions' dropdown. Select "Request Access".

4) This will open the Data Access Request Tool where you can enter the title of your research, your Research Data Use Statement, and the contact information for you and your collaborators. You will also select the Signing Official at your research institution from a drop down list.  

You must work at a research institution that has an active [Federal-Wide Assurance](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/federalwide-assurances-fwas.html) in order to initiate a data access request.  
Data access requests for controlled access permission groups should include a Research Data Use Statement that appropriately addresses consent-based data use limitations for that permission group.  All BRAIN/NeMO datasets are listed in the NDA Controlled Access Permission Group table.  Look at the “Data Use Limitations” field to determine if there are consent-based data use limitations to which authorized researchers must adhere.

5) Download and sign the Data Use Certification PDF from the Data Access Request Tool and complete with signatures by both investigator and institutional Signing Official. [Contact the NDA Help Desk](Email to: ndahelp@mail.nih.gov) if you need assistance identifying Signing Officials at your research institution.  

6) Log into the NDA Permissions Dashboard and upload the signed DUC on the “Active Requests” section on the top of the NDA Permissions Dashboard.  

7)	Your data access request will be reviewed by an NIH Data Access Committee (DAC).  

8) NDA will inform investigators and NeMO of a final access decision, at which time NeMO will reach out to all investigators and collaborators included on the access request. NeMO will grant data access to investigator for ***one year***, after which investigators will need to reapply for access using the process described above. 

### Creating an institutional google account

Consented data will be available from NeMO through the Google cloud platform (gcp). ***Please read the following carefully:***

Any consented user wishing to download data must create a google account at [myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/), **USING THE SAME INSTITUTIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS USED FOR NDA ACCOUNT CREATION**. 

If you are ***not*** currently logged in as a google user, select "Create a Google Account" at the bottom of the screen. If you ***are*** currently logged in as a google user, you can select "Use Another Account" and then "Create Account". When creating an account, you should see an option to use a current email address instead of creating an @gmail.com address. Be sure to select this and sign up with your institutional email address. Following remaining prompts to create your account.

Documentation on accessing data through google cloud platform is coming soon.
