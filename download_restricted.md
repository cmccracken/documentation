# Accessing Restricted Data

### Obtaining NDA Approval

Permissions for restricted data access at NeMO are being facilitated by the [NIMH Data Archives (NDA)](https://nda.nih.gov/). NDA and NeMO are working together to ensure a smooth process. We regret to inform you that prior dbGap access authorization does not transfer to NDA, therefore a separate NDA access request will need to be submitted.

NDA provides a [tutorial on accessing shared NIMH data here](https://nda.nih.gov/training/module?trainingModuleId=training.access&slideId=slide.access.intro). Note that only the first few steps of this tutorial are applicable in this case, as data is being stored at NeMO, rather than at NIMH. 

The steps required for restricted data access are as follows:

1)	[Create an NDA account](https://nda.nih.gov/user/create_account.html)  
**NDA ACCOUNT REQUESTS MUST BE MADE USING AN INSTITUTIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS**. Account requests made from a personal account will not be honored by NeMO and will therefore greatly slow down the process of accessing data.

2) Log in to the NDA Permissions Dashboard, and navigate to Get Data --> Request Data Access.

3) Identify the relevant BRAIN Data Archives dataset(s). To the right is an 'Actions' dropdown. Select "Request Access".

4) This will trigger generation of pdf Data Use Certification (DUC) form, which must be filled in, complete with signatures by ***both*** investigator and institution signing official. Submit completed DUC form to NDA.

5) NDA will inform investigators and NeMO of final acess decision, at which time NeMO will reach out to all investigators and collaborators included on the access request. NeMO will grant data access to investigator for ***one year***, after which investigators will need to reply. 

### Creating an institutional google account

Consented data will be available from NeMO through the Google cloud platform (gcp). ***Please read the following carefully:***

Any consented user wishing to download data must create a google account at [myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/), **USING THE SAME INSTITUTIONAL EMAIL ADDRESS USED FOR NDA ACCOUNT CREATION**. 

If you are ***not*** currently logged in as a google user, select "Create a Google Account" at the bottom of the screen. If you ***are*** currently logged in as a google user, you can select "Use Another Account" and then "Create Account". When creating an account, you should see an option to use a current email address instead of creating an @gmail.com address. Be sure to select this and sign up with your institutional email address. Following remaining prompts to create your account.
