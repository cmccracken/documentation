### Data Browsing
There are two mechanisms for browsing open access data available through NeMO Archives. The HTTP browser is intended for those having some familiarity with the data structure. Data is organized by grant, lab, modality and organism. 
The NeMO Portal provides faceted and advanced search tools for those interested in exploring and/or filtering datasets and downloading in bulk or exporting to other analysis tools. Browsing restricted access data requires [authorization by NDA](link to be added).
